Welcome to My Computer Networks Project! 

In this project, I explore key networking concepts such as DNS, IP addressing, and network protocols, while demonstrating them through an interactive website. The goal is to provide an engaging way to understand the fundamentals of networking and security.

What You'll Find Here:
 Overview of Networking Concepts – Learn about how DNS works, how IP addresses are assigned, and the importance of network protocols like HTTP/HTTPS.
 Hands-On Examples – Interactive sections to visualize and apply these concepts.
 Security Enhancements – Implementation of Google reCAPTCHA for authentication and HTTPS for secure communication.
 Flashcard Game – Test your networking knowledge with an interactive quiz!
 Project Documentation – A step-by-step breakdown of how the website was built, networking principles applied, and challenges faced.
Feel free to explore, interact, and gain a deeper understanding of how the internet and networks function!
